# Terraform + AWS CLI + Docker CLI + GIT = TADG Docker Image

The hardest container image to find on dockerhub; So I build my own ðŸ¤ª

This image packs the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)
and [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [GIT](https://git-scm.com/).

This makes it really easy to build push and deploy projects using Container Images,
with [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) Repositories
and any other AWS Service you like.
